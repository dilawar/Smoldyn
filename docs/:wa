.. warning:: This is a work in progress.

.. note::
    
   Smoldyn supports Python version 3.6 or higher. For Python version 3.6, you
   have to install `dataclasses` module manually. If you are using ``pip`` to
   install ``smnoldyn`` then ``dataclasses`` is installed automatically for
   Python version 3.6.

Installing Python module
-------------------------

Use ``pip`` to install Smoldyn. See
`<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_  for how to install and use
``pip``.

.. code-block::

    $ python3 -m pip install smoldyn --user

After successful installation, you can verify by running the following command in the terminal.

.. code-block::

    $ python3 -c "import smoldyn; print(smoldyn.__version)"
    '2.62.dev'

If installation fails for some reason or your platform is not supported, you
can build the Python module by yourself.  Refer to the section `Compiling
Smoldyn`_.  Feel free to open a ticket on the `Github repository
<https://github.com/ssandrews/Smoldyn-official` or write to
`<support@smoldyn.org>`.

.. todo:: Add Python build instructions to the docs.

Quick Comparison 
-----------------

If you are already familiar with Smoldyn then I recommend that you compare
Smoldyn's plain text model with equivalent Python model in ``examples``
directory. Not all models are translated to Python but there are enough to get
you started.


Here is an example which shows plain text and Python module side by side
